1. The e bikes starting early My seeding was not correct I had to shout most of the time to keep your lane or keep left 
2. Marshaling was poor Most of the times they did not show the route and dangers on the route  
3. There was no medals at the finish  Cutoff was changed to pm  too 
4. Non 
5. Expo was disappointing Less exhibitors every year 
6. none 
7. none 
8. starting alongside the squatter camp at the castle  the stench was awful I do understand their situation though  
9. Nothing 
10. The starting arena was a bit confusing regarding the area where you need to enter to start at the correct time I can recommend better directions and indications to the actual starting point 
11. The expo starts to wind down It starts to lose its vibe in the buildup to the cycling day 
12. Cyclists congested at starting point  Riders on ebikes  their attitude sucks riding as though they are top class cyclists meanwhile doing it on an ebike is it really cycling 
13. Dislike VERY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE TO THE RIDERS THAT ONE MUST AT ALL TIMES KEEP LEFT Accidents happened and we had a couple of close calls due to INCONSIDERED riders 
14. Parking is always a problem  Have to be really too early to find a parking A few years ago there were lots of cookies and bananas and stuff I looked farward to that but the last few years nothing was offered but water and coke We dont all race for first place We ride for fun too 
15. No free coffees at the end 
16. Strange seeding anomalies and Ebikes as part of the same race 
17. wind 
18. The waterbottle fills ups at the water points last year with the cups was nicer for example if you just want a shot of coke now your first need to clean your bottle for a little bit of coke and then refill again
